<h2>setup</h2>
The setup is based on client-base-project but webpack is used so we can do more :
<ul>
<li>use import\export</li>
<li>bundle all js files into one file dist/bundle.js</li>
<li>two webpack config files : webpack.config.js for development and webpack.config.prod.js for production</li>
</ul>
